// src/protocol/ports.ts
//
// Layering seam (Step 07). `account/` owns the Baileys socket + the per-account
// event forwarder; `wa/` owns the WhatsApp message/command logic. Historically
// the two packages imported each other (worked around with lazy `await
// import()`), forming an `account/ ↔ wa/` cycle.
//
// This module breaks that cycle by declaring the INTERFACES that cross the
// boundary, in the lowest layer (`protocol/`, which everyone may import):
//
//   - `WaSocketLike` — the subset of the Baileys `WASocket` surface the gateway
//     actually uses. `wa/*` helpers and the per-account holders depend on this
//     instead of `sock: any`, and `account/` assigns the concrete `WASocket`
//     (which is structurally assignable to it).
//   - `AccountForwarder` — what `wa/` needs FROM `account/` to push Baileys
//     events to the Python client. `wa/events.ts` / `wa/inbound.ts` reach it via
//     `AccountContext.forwarder` instead of statically importing
//     `account/eventForwarder.ts`, so `wa/` no longer imports `account/`.
//
// TYPES ONLY — this module emits nothing at runtime.
