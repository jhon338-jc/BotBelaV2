# Step 12: the bridge's outbound action helpers below send EXCLUSIVELY through
# the public WaSocket SDK action methods (``ws.send_message`` etc.), passing the
# bridge's own ``request_id``. This replaces the former private-transport bypass
# and hand-rolled ``json`` framing: the wire protocol is now encoded in exactly
# one place (``wasocket/protocol.py``), and the SDK's ``PendingAcks`` ack/timeout
# net covers these sends too. The bridge's own ``requestId``->pending-map
# correlation + the Step-29 ``action_ack`` EVENT hydration are unchanged — the
# SAME ``request_id`` still goes on the wire, and the SDK does NOT block these
# calls on the ack (it registers the pending future and returns immediately for
# a caller-supplied ``request_id``), preserving the prior best-effort,
# fire-and-forget timing the bridge relies on.
