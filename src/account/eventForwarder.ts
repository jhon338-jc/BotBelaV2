/**
 * eventForwarder.ts — per-account Baileys→Python event forwarder (Step 18).
 *
 * This module is the single choke point that turns the two Baileys events the
 * Python bridge cares about — an inbound message and a connection-state change —
 * into the contract's `incoming_message` / `whatsapp_status` {@link OutboundFrame}s
 * and delivers them to the RIGHT Python client.
 *
 * Two responsibilities, nothing more (CONTRACT.md §1.4 / §1.1 / §7):
 *   - {@link forwardIncoming} stamps `payload.folderPath = entry.folderPath`
 *     (so §7's `folderPath` is now ALWAYS present on `incoming_message`) and
 *     sends best-effort.
 *   - {@link forwardStatus} normalizes the {@link WaStatus} (`closed→close`,
 *     CONTRACT.md §1.1) and sends reliably (queued if the client is unbound).
 *
 * Delivery topology:
 *   Both `incoming_message` and `whatsapp_status` are handed to the account
 *   registry (`accountRegistry.sendToClient` / `sendReliableToClient`), which
 *   delivers to the account's bound Python client (or drops/queues when none is
 *   bound). Routing both events through the registry guarantees EXACTLY-ONCE
 *   delivery (no double-send) and one consistent path for both events (Step 18)
 *   and control events (Step 21).
 *
 * Scope guard (per the step spec): this module does NOT handle actions
 * (Step 19), emit control events (Step 21), or run the WS server (Step 20).
