  ``image``/``sticker`` kinds because that is all a vision model needs —
  the sub-agent operates on ANY attachment kind: PDFs, ``.docx`` /
  ``.xlsx`` / ``.pptx``, plain text, audio, video, archives, etc.

  With lazy media (feature 8) inbound forwards attachment metadata WITHOUT
  downloading the bytes (``path: None``, ``pending: True``), and the only
  on-demand fetch path (``materialize_visual_media``) deliberately skips
  non-visual kinds. The result was that when LLM2 delegated a document to
  the sub-agent via ``execute_subtask``, the file's bytes were never
  downloaded, ``media_paths_by_chat`` held no usable path for it, and the
  sub-agent silently received nothing — the user-visible symptom being
  "the bot ignored the file I sent".

  For each ctx_id that does not already resolve to a real file on disk,
  download it on demand (any kind) and record the resolved path via the
  same shape :func:`_store_media_path` uses, so the caller's existing

  left unresolved and simply omitted from the sub-agent inputs, exactly as
  before this fix.

  When ``history`` is supplied, ctx_ids that history knows are text-only
  (their :class:`~bridge.history.WhatsAppMessage` carries no ``media`` kind)
  are skipped WITHOUT a download attempt: requesting their bytes only makes
