# wasocket/transport.py
#
# WSClientTransport — the resilient WebSocket *client* layer of the WaSocket
# SDK. This is a 1:1 Python port of the original ``src/wsClient.ts`` (the Node
# gateway's ``LLMWebSocket``, removed when the topology was reversed): exponential backoff with symmetric jitter, the
# canonical ``isAlive`` heartbeat (check-then-ping / terminate-on-missed-pong),
# the accept-then-kick grace timer, a bounded reliable queue, the
# ``hello``/``hello_ack`` handshake, and graceful close.
#
# Scope (Step 26):
#   - ``compute_reconnect_delay`` — EXACT port of ``computeReconnectDelay``
#     (same formula + clamp to ``max_ms``; injectable ``rand``).
#   - ``class WSClientTransport`` — opens the socket, performs the
#     ``hello``/``hello_ack`` handshake (CONTRACT.md §1.1), pumps raw *decoded*
#     frames to an ``on_frame`` callback, exposes best-effort ``send`` and a
#     bounded reliable queue (CONTRACT.md §1.6), reconnects with backoff +
#     OPEN-grace ``attempt`` reset, runs the heartbeat, and closes gracefully.
#
# The transport EMITS raw decoded frames (``protocol.decode`` results) to
# ``on_frame``; it does NOT interpret them.
#
# Intentionally NOT here (later steps):
#   - No action methods (send_message/react/etc.).
#   - No ``request_id`` generation (Step 25 / correlation.py; CONTRACT.md §3).
#   - No event dispatch / ``on()`` decorator / public ``WaSocket`` API (Step 27).
#   - No agent logic.
