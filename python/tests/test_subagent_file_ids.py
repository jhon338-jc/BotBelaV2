"""Regression tests for the ``<files_in_chat>`` lookup table that tells LLM2
which contextMsgId actually HOLDS a file for ``execute_subtask``.

Background: the model reliably decides *to* delegate, but it tended to pass the
latest request/mention message's ID to ``context_msg_ids`` instead of the
message that contains the file. The resolver then found no attachment and the
sub-agent silently received nothing. ``_files_for_subagent_block`` removes that
inference by listing the exact ``[#NNNNNN] -> file`` mapping.
