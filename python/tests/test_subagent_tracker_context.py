"""Pin the context-block contracts that prevent the post-task delivery loop.

The user-visible bug these tests guard against:

  - The bot keeps replying "Sure, I'll check the document" over and over even
    after the sub-agent has finished, and the actual report never reaches
    the user.

The fixes rely on three context blocks that LLM2 sees:

  1. ``format_context()`` — when a task is in flight, must tell LLM2 not to
     re-acknowledge or re-spawn the same task.
  2. ``format_recent_finished()`` — for follow-up bursts after delivery,
     must mark the task as already-delivered so LLM2 does not redo it.
  3. The post-task re-invoke ``subagent_result_block`` (built in main.py)
     uses ``[SUBTASK FINISHED]`` from the same tracker state. The recent-
     finished helper must keep that report intact.
