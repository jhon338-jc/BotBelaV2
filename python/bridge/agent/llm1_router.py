"""``Llm1Router`` — the should-respond / express decision (Step 09).

Lifts the LLM1 *routing orchestration* out of the ``process_message_batch``
closure in ``session.py`` into an injectable collaborator. The actual model
call + prompt assembly + fallback/validation primitives stay in
``llm/llm1.py``; this class is a thin, testable seam over them.

``route()`` wraps :func:`bridge.llm.llm1.call_llm1` and returns the SAME
:class:`~bridge.llm.schemas.LLM1Decision` object the batch flow consumed before
(``should_response`` / ``confidence`` / ``reason`` / express fields). The
``call_llm1`` callable is injected so the router is unit-testable with a fake
(no network, no LLM SDK). Confidence/routing semantics and the
LLM1-skip-in-private-chat behaviour live unchanged in ``call_llm1`` and its
callers — this class does not alter them.
